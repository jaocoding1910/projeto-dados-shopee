# projeto-dados-shopee

Exploratory data analysis of logistics operations using Python and SQL, focusing on operational KPIs and backlog identification.

---

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to simulate and analyze logistics operational data in order to identify bottlenecks, monitor backlog levels, and support data-driven decision making.

This project was designed as a portfolio study for data analysis roles, especially in logistics and e-commerce environments.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- SQL (basic queries)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset simulates logistics operations data with the following fields:

- `pedido_id`: Order identifier  
- `status`: Current order status (Backlog, Packed, Outbounded)  
- `data_recebimento`: Order received date  
- `received`: Flag indicating received orders  
- `packed`: Flag indicating packed orders  
- `outbounded`: Flag indicating shipped orders  

---

## 📈 Analysis Performed
- Exploratory data analysis using Pandas
- Identification of backlog orders
- Status distribution analysis
- Backlog percentage calculation

---

## 🔑 Key Metrics (KPIs)
- Total number of orders
- Number of backlog orders
- Percentage of backlog

These metrics help highlight operational bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

## ▶️ How to Run

Run the Python analysis:
```bash
python Scripts/analise.py
